https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.formole.formOle

- Challenge in FormOle: The primary task was to develop an intuitive mobile app for virtual sports coaching, capable of analyzing sports actions through user-uploaded videos.
- My Approach: Utilizing TensorFlow and deep learning, I implemented an AI-driven analysis feature within the React Native app. This system processes the videos, providing users with actionable insights to enhance their sports performance.

- Impact of the Project:
○ FormOle has evolved into a comprehensive mobile platform that offers more than just virtual coaching; it's a community hub for sports enthusiasts to share achievements and challenges.
○ The app integrates sophisticated AI analysis with user-friendly features, enabling athletes to refine their skills and engage with a broader community.
		
This experience demonstrates my ability to integrate cutting-edge technologies in mobile app development, creating products that are not only technologically advanced but also user-centric and community-driven.
